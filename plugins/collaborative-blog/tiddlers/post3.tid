This is the first installment in our "Community Voices" series, where we share oral histories and personal stories from long-time residents. Today, we're honored to share excerpts from our interview with Mary Thompson, who has lived in our town for over 70 years.

!! Growing Up in the 1950s

'''Jennifer''': Mary, thank you so much for sitting down with us. Can you tell us what the town was like when you were growing up?

'''Mary''': Oh, it was completely different! Main Street had five different shops - a bakery, a hardware store, the five-and-dime, a pharmacy with a soda fountain, and of course, the grocery. Everyone knew everyone. You couldn't walk down the street without stopping to chat with at least three people.

'''Jennifer''': What was your favorite place in town?

'''Mary''': The library, hands down. It was in the old Carnegie building - beautiful red brick with those tall windows. Mrs. Patterson was the librarian, and she knew exactly what books each child would love. She'd save them for us. I read everything I could get my hands on.

!! Changes Over the Decades

'''Jennifer''': You've seen so many changes over the years. What stands out most?

'''Mary''': The biggest change has been the sense of community. Not that people aren't friendly now - they are! But we used to have more shared spaces and events. The annual Fourth of July parade was massive. The whole town would shut down. Everyone would march or watch. There'd be picnics in the park afterward.

'''Jennifer''': Do you think we've lost something?

'''Mary''': In some ways, yes. But we've gained things too. The diversity in our town now is wonderful. When I was young, everyone looked pretty much the same. Now we have people from all over the world, different restaurants, different perspectives. That enriches all of us.

!! Advice for Future Generations

'''Jennifer''': What would you want young people today to know?

'''Mary''': Listen to the old stories. Talk to the elderly folks in your community. We won't be around forever, and we carry memories that aren't written in any book. Also, get involved. Don't wait for someone else to preserve history or improve the community. You can do it.

'''Jennifer''': Such wise words. Thank you, Mary.
