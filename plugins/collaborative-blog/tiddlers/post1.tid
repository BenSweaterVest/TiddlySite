We're thrilled to announce the launch of our new collaborative blog! After months of planning and development, we've created a platform that makes it easy for multiple contributors to share their knowledge, stories, and insights with our community.

!! Why We Created This Site

Traditional content management systems can be heavy, complicated, and expensive to maintain. We wanted something different:

* '''Lightweight''': Fast loading times and minimal server requirements
* '''Collaborative''': Easy for multiple authors to contribute
* '''Accessible''': Clean, readable design that works for everyone
* '''Sustainable''': Low maintenance overhead and costs

!! What Makes This Different

This site is built on TiddlyWiki, a unique "non-linear personal web notebook" that we've customized to work like a modern blog. Unlike WordPress or other traditional platforms, everything runs in a single HTML file - no database, no complex server setup.

!! What's Next

In the coming weeks, you'll see:

* Regular blog posts from our team members
* Historical articles and research findings
* Community stories and oral histories
* Resource guides and educational materials

We invite you to explore the site, read our content, and check back regularly for updates!
