After months of planning and development, we've created a platform that makes it easy for multiple contributors to share their knowledge, stories, and insights with our community.\n\n!! Why We Created This Site\n\nTraditional content management systems can be heavy, complicated, and expensive to maintain. We wanted something different:\n\n* '''Lightweight''': Fast loading times and minimal server requirements\n* '''Collaborative''': Easy for multiple authors to contribute\n* '''Accessible''': Clean, readable design that works for everyone\n* '''Sustainable''': Low maintenance overhead and costs\n\n!! What Makes This Different\n\nThis site is built on TiddlyWiki, a unique \"non-linear personal web notebook\" that we've customized to work like a modern blog. Unlike WordPress or other traditional platforms, everything runs in a single HTML file - no database, no complex server setup.\n\n!! What's Next\n\nIn the coming weeks, you'll see:\n\n* Regular blog posts from our team members\n* Historical articles and research findings\n* Community stories and oral histories\n* Resource guides and educational materials\n\nWe invite you to explore the site, read our content, and check back regularly for updates!\n\n---\n\n''Have feedback about the new site?

This question has guided much of our recent work in digital preservation.\n\n!! The Challenge\n\nHistorical societies and local archives often operate with limited budgets and small teams. Yet the demand for digitization has never been higher. Community members want access to:\n\n* Historical photographs and documents\n* Oral history recordings\n* Maps and architectural drawings\n* Personal letters and diaries\n\n!! Our Approach\n\nOver the past year, we've developed a systematic approach to digital preservation:\n\n!!! 1. Assessment and Prioritization\n\nWe begin by surveying our collection and identifying items that are:\n\n* At risk of deterioration\n* Frequently requested by researchers\n* Of particular community significance\n\n!!! 2. Digitization Process\n\nOur digitization workflow includes:\n\n* High-resolution scanning (minimum 600 DPI for documents)\n* Audio restoration for oral histories\n* Metadata creation and cataloging\n* Quality control checks\n\n!!! 3. Access and Sharing\n\nDigital preservation isn't just about storage - it's about access. We're committed to making our collections available through:\n\n* Online databases\n* Virtual exhibits\n* Educational programs\n* Community events\n\n!! Lessons Learned\n\nSome key insights from our digitization journey:\n\n* '''Start small''': Begin with a manageable pilot project\n* '''Document everything''': Create clear procedures and standards\n* '''Engage the community''': Local knowledge is invaluable\n* '''Plan for the long term''': Digital preservation is an ongoing commitment\n\n!! Get Involved\n\nWe're always looking for volunteers to help with digitization projects. If you're interested in hands-on historical preservation work, please [[Contact]] us to learn more.\n\n---\n\n''Michael Chen is the Digital Archivist and has been with the organization since 2019.''\n"

Today, we're honored to share excerpts from our interview with Mary Thompson, who has lived in our town for over 70 years.\n\n!! Growing Up in the 1950s\n\n'''Jennifer''': Mary, thank you so much for sitting down with us. Can you tell us what the town was like when you were growing up?\n\n'''Mary''': Oh, it was completely different! Main Street had five different shops - a bakery, a hardware store, the five-and-dime, a pharmacy with a soda fountain, and of course, the grocery. Everyone knew everyone. You couldn't walk down the street without stopping to chat with at least three people.\n\n'''Jennifer''': What was your favorite place in town?\n\n'''Mary''': The library, hands down. It was in the old Carnegie building - beautiful red brick with those tall windows. Mrs. Patterson was the librarian, and she knew exactly what books each child would love. She'd save them for us. I read everything I could get my hands on.\n\n!! Changes Over the Decades\n\n'''Jennifer''': You've seen so many changes over the years. What stands out most?\n\n'''Mary''': The biggest change has been the sense of community. Not that people aren't friendly now - they are! But we used to have more shared spaces and events. The annual Fourth of July parade was massive. The whole town would shut down. Everyone would march or watch. There'd be picnics in the park afterward.\n\n'''Jennifer''': Do you think we've lost something?\n\n'''Mary''': In some ways, yes. But we've gained things too. The diversity in our town now is wonderful. When I was young, everyone looked pretty much the same. Now we have people from all over the world, different restaurants, different perspectives. That enriches all of us.\n\n!! Advice for Future Generations\n\n'''Jennifer''': What would you want young people today to know?\n\n'''Mary''': Listen to the old stories. Talk to the elderly folks in your community. We won't be around forever, and we carry memories that aren't written in any book. Also, get involved. Don't wait for someone else to preserve history or improve the community. You can do it.\n\n'''Jennifer''': Such wise words. Thank you, Mary.\n\n---\n\n''This interview was conducted on October 15, 2025, as part of our ongoing oral history project.
